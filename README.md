### ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Nora and I like to be a pro âœ¨frontend developer!âœ¨

 ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal page to introduce myself, my skills and projects done so far.
 
 ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Figma, React, MySQL, PHP and Cypress. I'm very interested in the whole lifecycle of web-developing.
 
 ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any kind of projects.
 
 ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ideas! Practice is one of the most important things but sometimes it's not so easy to come up with a good project idea. ğŸ˜‰
 
 ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
